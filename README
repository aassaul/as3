My own AS3 frameworks. Used regularly on my own work created for Firstborn or personal projects.

This has everything put together and a little bit of a cross-dependency between packages (although I try to make packages as self-sufficient as possible).

Of notable importance:

* com.zehfernando.data.AssetLibrary - Dynamic Asset library manager.
* com.zehfernando.data.Color - Helpful color class.
* com.zehfernando.display.components.RichTextSprite - TLE-based rich text element. Powerful, but still lacking some features.
* com.zehfernando.display.containers.* - ImageContainer, VideoContainer, YoutubeVideoContainer, and other containers with a common API for size control and loading/unloading.
* com.zehfernando.display.decorators.* - My decorators, to avoid using a lot of getters/setters or "special" tweenings for objects.
* com.zehfernando.display.progressbars.* - Simple, value-attenuated progress bars.
* com.zehfernando.display.shapes.* - Simple shapes like circles, boxes, triangles and others, for code-based shape building.
* com.zehfernando.localization.* - Classes for external text maintenance and localization.
* com.zehfernando.navigation.* - Classes for internal navigation (SWFAddress). Very much work in progress and still with a few internal hacks.
* com.zehfernando.net.* - Classes for queued loading, and limited APIs for common usage (Bit.Ly, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube).
* com.zehfernando.transition.ZTween - ZTween, a simple+fast+small tween engine rebuilt from scratch. No 'special' properties or features whatsoever. Work in progress in a way.
* com.zehfernando.utils.* - Bunch of utils that don't really fit anywhere else now.

Package names, class locations, and overall structure can and will change at will (I'm refactoring-happy).
